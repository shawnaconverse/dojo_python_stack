# Git Discussion

## What is Git?

- Git is NOT GitHub
- Version Control / Source Control
  - backup our code
  - track the changes in  our code (both additions and deletions)
    - line by line
      - image how big the backup would be if we constantly save whole files
  - track who made those changes
  - track when those changes were made
  - track where those changes were applied
- Git runs and stores the changes on our local machine
  - create a repository
    - parent folder where we store our project(s)
  - git will track all the changes in this repository (repo)
    - stored in a folder called .git
  - .gitignore file
    - allows us to specify folders and files we don't want saved as part of the repo

## What is Github?

- Cloud storage
  - store our repos online
- allows us to move our code from machine to machine
- allows us to share and collaborate on projects between developers
